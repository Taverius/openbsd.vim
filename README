This color scheme uses dark background and sober colors to develop without headache ;-)

The colors of the terminal version could be more pleasant if you use modified colors in .Xdefaults (or .Xresources depending on your O.S.)

You can contact me to get my .Xdefaults color theme (for xterm and urxvt): dsw [AT] mailoo.org

Enjoy!

PS: Sorry for my bad english...
